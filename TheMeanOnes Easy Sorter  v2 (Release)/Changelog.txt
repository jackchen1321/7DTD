v1.0 - Initial Release
- Adds Sorting to Unlocked Crates & Trash Buttons. 
- Buttons CTRL F were sort and CTRL T was trash. 

Known Issue with Initial Release:
- Players could access ALL crates, even if not on team. 
- Players wanted easier function. 


v2.
- Changed functionality of Mod as a whole. Added new features:
- Quick Refill, Locked or Unlocked Slots can be refilled now with CTRL K button combo. It will refill to max
stack size. 
- Implemented party system so that when in party, players can directly send items to crates, and also pull from crates
with CTRL F and CTRL K. 
- Fixed the out of party issue, now players out of your party can ONLY transfer IN and not transfer out any items (This
was to primarily prevent griefers).
- Implemented transfers to locked crates or unlocked  with dual functionality for added base protection on PvP servers. 
- Refactored the LoadConfig() to be a failsafe. Now uses XmlDocument.Load() inside of a try/catch block. 
- Added additional tooltips and information that comes across screen and added MORE debug logging. It has coords, player and crate.
- Lock Slots will be ignored now if quick transferring out items. 

Known Issue with Initial Release:
- None


Plans Next:
